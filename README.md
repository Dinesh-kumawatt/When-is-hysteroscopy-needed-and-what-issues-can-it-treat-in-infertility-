Hysteroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that lets a specialist directly view and treat the uterine cavity using a thin scope inserted through the cervix. It’s indicated when there are suspected intrauterine problems that may affect fertility or embryo implantation, such as polyps, submucosal fibroids, adhesions (Asherman’s syndrome), congenital uterine anomalies, or retained products after miscarriage. Hysteroscopy can both diagnose and treat many of these problems in the same sitting, improving the uterine environment for future conception or embryo transfer. For infertility patients, correcting intrauterine pathology via hysteroscopy often improves implantation rates and pregnancy outcomes; recovery is typically quick, and the procedure is commonly done under sedation or general anesthesia depending on the case. Your fertility team will recommend hysteroscopy based on ultrasound, saline sonography, or clinical history.
